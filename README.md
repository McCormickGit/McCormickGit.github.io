# ***Jarred McCormick Eportfolio:***

This is my final for the Southern New Hampshire University CS-499 Computer Science Capstone.
This eportfolio contains a narrated code review, enhancements to be completed accross the 
three major graded areas: Software Design and Engineering, Algorithms and Data Structures,
and Databases.  I have decided to approach this project from the perspective of my first failure
within the program to show how much I have grown.

***Note***:

As I discuss my approach to this project I picked one of my first programs I wrote for this program.
This first application that I wrote didn’t work, but that’s why I picked it.  I hope to showcase my growth
by taking a simple program and layering on top of the core idea of it to display my programing skillset. 

# 1. Professional Self-Assessment:

I started my journey with Southern New Hampshire University in 2017.  Looking back at the time that I spent at the school I can say that I have learned a lot.  My approach to learning has changed over the years but there are a few things that have changed.  With my journey coming to an end this semester, I have taken the time to reflect on what made this degree worth it.  When it comes to a professional assessment, I can say that I have grown, and that I am walking away with a “tool bag” full of tools that I can use to solve a litany of problems.  The project that I based all my final project on was a failure for me, I couldn’t complete the project satisfactorily in any meaningful way.  It took me several weeks of troubleshooting after the introduction to python course ended before I understood fully what I did wrong.

Taking that lesson in stride I learned my first real lesson from this degree plan, plan to fail.  I don’t ever plan on getting things right the first time and have learned that building in time to fail multiple times before the deadline is necessary for me.  The second lesson that I have learned is to give myself time to draw up my solution.  I built the scaffolding for this final project out on my dry erase board in my office.  This allowed me to visualize what I was going to create, and how it would function.  I also learned my final lesson in the capstone, relax.  No matter how much stress I cannot be perfect, but I can get close to perfect.  I have learned how to take and build in time to relax, and the results for my projects have been amazing.  I have found that my productivity has gone up, and I’m not worried about the time left before the assignments are due.

In this final project you will find that I have built an application that supports the following: a flexible product for collaborating in a team environment, competency with communicating with stakeholders, data structures and algorithms, and databases, and security.   

The structure of my project lends itself to the iterative nature of software development using documentation and comments to clearly define what is happening and why it is happening within the code base.  By understanding the rubric and communicating with the professor on this project and my code review I have shown my ability to communicate with stakeholders.  The inclusion of the binary search tree and the quick sort algorithms show my understanding and implementation of them.  Finally, by building and designing an interface for a locally stored database shows my understanding and design of database theory.
