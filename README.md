# ***Jarred McCormick Eportfolio:***

This is my final for the Southern New Hampshire University CS-499 Computer Science Capstone.
This eportfolio contains a narrated code review, enhancements to be completed accross the 
three major graded areas: Software Design and Engineering, Algorithms and Data Structures,
and Databases.  I have decided to approach this project from the perspective of my first failure
within the program to show how much I have grown.
