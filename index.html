<h1 id="jarred-mccormick-eportfolio"><strong><em>Jarred McCormick
Eportfolio:</em></strong></h1>
<p>This is my final for the Southern New Hampshire University CS-499
Computer Science Capstone. This eportfolio contains a narrated code
review, enhancements to be completed accross the three major graded
areas: Software Design and Engineering, Algorithms and Data Structures,
and Databases. I have decided to approach this project from the
perspective of my first failure within the program to show how much I
have grown.</p>

<p><strong><em>Note</em></strong>:</p>
<p>As I discuss my approach to this project I picked one of my first
programs I wrote for this program. This first application that I wrote
didn’t work, but that’s why I picked it. I hope to showcase my growth by
taking a simple program and layering on top of the core idea of it to
display my programing skillset.</p>
<h1 id="professional-self-assessment">1. Professional
Self-Assessment:</h1>
<p>I started my journey with Southern New Hampshire University in 2017.
Looking back at the time that I spent at the school I can say that I
have learned a lot. My approach to learning has changed over the years
but there are a few things that have changed. With my journey coming to
an end this semester, I have taken the time to reflect on what made this
degree worth it. When it comes to a professional assessment, I can say
that I have grown, and that I am walking away with a “tool bag” full of
tools that I can use to solve a litany of problems. The project that I
based all my final project on was a failure for me, I couldn’t complete
the project satisfactorily in any meaningful way. It took me several
weeks of troubleshooting after the introduction to python course ended
before I understood fully what I did wrong.</p>
<p>Taking that lesson in stride I learned my first real lesson from this
degree plan, plan to fail. I don’t ever plan on getting things right the
first time and have learned that building in time to fail multiple times
before the deadline is necessary for me. The second lesson that I have
learned is to give myself time to draw up my solution. I built the
scaffolding for this final project out on my dry erase board in my
office. This allowed me to visualize what I was going to create, and how
it would function. I also learned my final lesson in the capstone,
relax. No matter how much stress I cannot be perfect, but I can get
close to perfect. I have learned how to take and build in time to relax,
and the results for my projects have been amazing. I have found that my
productivity has gone up, and I’m not worried about the time left before
the assignments are due.</p>
<p>In this final project you will find that I have built an application
that supports the following: a flexible product for collaborating in a
team environment, competency with communicating with stakeholders, data
structures and algorithms, and databases, and security.</p>
<p>The structure of my project lends itself to the iterative nature of
software development using documentation and comments to clearly define
what is happening and why it is happening within the code base. By
understanding the rubric and communicating with the professor on this
project and my code review I have shown my ability to communicate with
stakeholders. The inclusion of the binary search tree and the quick sort
algorithms show my understanding and implementation of them. Finally, by
building and designing an interface for a locally stored database shows
my understanding and design of database theory.</p>
<h1 id="where-we-started"><strong><em>Where We
Started</em></strong>:</h1>
<p>The project that this is based on is from my first year as a student
in the Computer Scicnet program. It was a terminal application that
allowed the user to filter movies based of off their title. It can be
found in the main.py file. It’s output and running environmment looked
like this: <img src="old%20application.png" alt="old application" /></p>
